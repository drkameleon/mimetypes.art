### What does this package do?

This package provides an ample (2000+) entry database of MIME content typse and their corresponding extensions and allows to easily look up the suitable extensions by file extension (or file path). It also supports the reverse operation: look up possible mime types, based on a given extension.

> [!TIP]
> For the data, the package has been based on the very useful list compiled by the [mime-db](https://github.com/jshttp/mime-db) project.

### How do I use it?

Simply `import` it and use the included `mimetype` function:

```arturo
import "mimetypes"!

mimetype "jpg"              ; => ["image/jpeg"]
mimetype "somefile.jpg"     ; => ["image/jpeg"]
mimetype "boom"             ; => []

mimetype.extensions "image/jpeg"
; => ["jpe","jpeg","jpg"]
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In case no suitable MIME type has been found for a given extension/path, or if the given MIME type isn't associated with any known extensions, then `mimetype` will return an empty block!
